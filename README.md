Add your [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API key in local.properties file.
```xml
API_KEY=add_your_api_key
```
and run the app.

## Tech stack
* âœ… MVVM with Clean Architecture
* âœ… [Kotlin Flow][33] - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* âœ… [LiveData][31] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* âœ… [Coroutines][51] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* âœ… [Navigation Component][24] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation. asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Safe-Args][25] - For passing data between destinations
* âœ… [Paging3][85] - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
* âœ… [Dagger-Hilt][93] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* âœ… [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Retrofit][90]- Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
* âœ… [OkHttp][23] - Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
* âœ… [Moshi][95] - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
* âœ… [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* âœ… [Data Binding][86] - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* âœ… [Lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
* âœ… [Glide][27] - for image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* âœ… [Timber][9] - This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
